 PEP 561 stub files for the `python-asana` package
===================================================

This stub only package adds type information for the python-asana_ client
library. It enables mypy_ and other static type checkers for Python to check
that code using the python-asana_ package passes and expects correct types.

**Note:** This is work in progress. The stubs are still incomplete.
